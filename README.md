This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Uses [react-virtualized](http://www.reactvirtualized.com) with flex-box, [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/) card & infinite scroll with data from [tmdb](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3). 18000+ records can be progressively scrolled without any performance issues.

There is also a non-virtualized version which uses [infinite-scroll](https://cassetterocks.github.io/react-infinite-scroller/) (to achieve load more on scroll down) and hangs browser after a few scrolls.
